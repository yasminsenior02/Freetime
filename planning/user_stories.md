## User Personas

**Student**

- Sam is a new college student at USC.

Sam is hoping to find a resource that can help him determine which restaurants are safe for him to eat out at.


**Restaurant owner**


- Joe is a 40 year old owner of “Eat Good, Feel Good”, an affordable healthy vegan own eatery. As the world eats unhealthier, less traction is brought to his restaurant. He is looking to attract more college students with his student deals.
